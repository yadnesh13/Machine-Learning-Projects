Project 1: Handwritten Digits Recognition using MNIST Dataset 
Description: A convolutional nueral network(CNN) implementation using a synthetic dataset. This project help the user be thorough with the basics of keras and neural networks and how to build a neural network & interpret the results.

Project 2: Image Classification with CNN
Description: Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using a popular dataset like MNIST or CIFAR-10. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters. 
It contains two models one made on Google Collab, this model classifies dogs and cats with the help of suoervised machine learning dataset is taken from kaggle.
The other model is also a supervised machine learning model which is made on jupyer notebook, this model classisifies happy and sad people.
